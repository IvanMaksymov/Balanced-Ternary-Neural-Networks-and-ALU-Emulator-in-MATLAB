This repository provides a complete MATLAB/Octave framework for experimenting with balanced-ternary computing, including:

1) A balanced ternary ALU emulator with multi-trit operations;

2) A simple, experimental ternary deep neural network prototype;

3) Training and inference on a ternarised MNIST dataset;

4) Support utilities for encoding/decoding balanced-ternary vectors.

This project is for researchers exploring non-binary computing, ternary logic circuits and unconventional neural network arithmetic. It began as a hobby project aimed at developing a deeper understanding of the opportunities offered by ternary neural networks. I intentionally avoided consulting the existing literature to build everything from scratch, hoping to think independently, avoid repeating the assumptions made by others (at least consciously), and perhaps even rediscover or create something genuinely new. As usual, no warranty is provided. You use this code at your own risk.
